# Introduction

Hi! This is a gemini version of my blog!

=> https://dhruvasambrani.github.io/blog	My HTTPS blog!

My blog is written in an enhanced markdown and then rendered to html by Franklin.jl. This allows me maximum flexibility while maintaining writing simplicity. I use certain extra features provided by Franklin toenhance my writing. However this implies that I cannot use normal md->gemini scripts, as the additional features are lost. I could write a parser equivalent to franklin but to gemini, but that would be a massive undertaking. Instead, I have marked out the content of my blog with custom tags which I can grep from the rendered site and use a simple html->gemini script to convert to gemini. This leads to a pretty good output, but it can have a few oddities, which I will try to fix, but ay not be able to. None the less, the gemini sites will definitely be legible, just with some formatting issues!

I will probably make a blog about this in the near future, but until then, please enjoy my other blogs!
